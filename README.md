Instructions for building a touch enabled smart mirror.
Note: Some of these materials were used because they were what I had around, or my personal preference. This is not the only way to build a touch enabled smart mirror.

## Materials:
Matte monitor (I used an extra Asus monitor I had laying around)
Raspberry Pi Model 3 B
Reflective Glass (70% Reflective 30% Transparent) http://www.twowaymirrors.com/smart-mirror/
3ft DVI-D Male to HDMI Male connector
Projected Capacitive touch foil
